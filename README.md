# Optimizing Classification for Cost-Sensitive Decision Making: A Deep Learning Approach

## Overview
This repository contains the final project for **DS 7333: Quantifying the World**, focusing on **cost-sensitive classification using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)**. The project aims to build a high-precision machine learning model that minimizes financial losses due to misclassification. The business requirement emphasizes that false positives are significantly more costly than false negatives, guiding the model selection, training, and evaluation.

)
  - **Data Preparation**:
    - Handling missing values, categorical encoding, feature transformations.
    - Different approaches to dataset modification (raw, imputed, and engineered features).
  - **Model Training & Evaluation**:
    - Logistic regression as a baseline.
    - Deep learning models implemented using TensorFlow/Keras.
    - ANN architectures with multiple layers, dropout layers, and hyperparameter tuning.
    - Model evaluation metrics: precision, recall, and financial cost minimization.

### 3. **Results & Findings**
- Multiple ANN models were tested with varying architectures.
- The **best-performing model** (Model 3) achieved the lowest monetary loss of **$57,270** by optimizing the classification threshold to 67%.
- Cross-validation confirmed model generalization.
